## Current research project

I am trying to estimate the selection pressure and evolutionary trends of different types of [structiral variants](https://github.com/eldariont/svim-asm#background). 
The first task is to benchmark available tools with empirical data because most previous evaluations of tools are based on simulation. Next step is calling the structural variants at a population level, which requires mush computational resources. Finall, we can catch the evolutionary signals with site frequency spectra and some statistics. 

My research target is fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) but our research methods can be applied to any organisms. I hope my research can contribute not only to the research society but also to human welfare.
