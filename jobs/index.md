# Opportunities in the Emerson Lab

## Postdoctoral position

We will soon be looking to hire an NIH-funded postdoctoral researcher. The job is pending approval of NIH funding, so no offers can yet be made. When the job becomes available, we will update this page. For informal inquiries, please [see my personal page](/people/Emerson.html).

## Undergraduate opportunities

We supervise undergraduate research as part of the [Bio 199 research course](https://www.bio.uci.edu/undergraduates/research/bio-199/). We are currently updating the website. When we update, this page will explain how to join the Emerson lab.
