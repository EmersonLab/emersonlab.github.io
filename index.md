# Emerson Lab Home Page
Welcome to the Emerson Lab's web page. We recently migrated our website.

We are are a research group based at the University of California, Irvine. We study evolutionary genetics, with an emphasis on natural variation in populations. We study many organisms, though we're quite partial to model genetic systems like the fruitfly *Drosophila melanogaster*, brewer's yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, and the bacteria *Escherichia coli*.
