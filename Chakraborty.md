<h2> About me </h2>
I did my Ph.D. from University of Rochester in 2014 and joined Emerson lab to study evolution of structural variation (SV) in Drosophila. Majority of my Ph.D. research was in functional evolutionary genetics (involving biochemistry, transgenics, phenotypic assays etc.) so I wanted to obtain research training in genomics and bioinformatics. In the Emerson lab, I spent the last three years learning about structural variation, genome evolution, and the methods to study them. In doing so, we developed methods for high quality genome assembly and comprehensive SV detection. I like solving challenges that require imagination and free thinking. During my postdoc at UCI, I was given freedom to do both. Also during these three years, I was fortunate to work with a group that pioneered a new era of genomics in Drosophila, wherein mutation discovery is facilitated by comparison between near-complete genome assemblies.

When I am not probing into the Drosophila genomes, I like to hike or cook. I am also part of an Indian NGO named Pratyush (meaning dawn), which is actively trying to improve the lives of economially under-privileged children and women.

<h2>Research interest</h2>

My primary interest is centered upon understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms by which heritable phenotypic variation originates and is  maintained in natural populations. Addressing this question requires discovery of functionally important genetic variation and determining the phenotypic and evolutionary consequences of the variation. Until my Ph.D., my focus was mainly on molecular variation caused by single nucleotide or small sequence changes. Presently I am more interested in understanding the phenotypic and evolutionary consequences of large scale sequence changes, including TE insertions and gene duplications.
