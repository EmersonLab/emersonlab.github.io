<h1>Mahul Chakraborty</h1>
<h2> About me </h2>
I did my Ph.D. from University of Rochester in 2014 and joined Emerson lab to study evolution of structural variation in Drosophila. Having done most of my Ph.D. research in functional evolutionary genetics (biochemistry, transgenics, phenotypic assays etc.), I knew very little about genome assembly or genotyping of structural variants (SV). Over the last three years in Emerson lab, I got to learn a lot about the new age of genomics and bioinformatics and applied my knowledge to advance the methods of genome assembly and comprehensive SV detection. Because I like solving challenges that require imagination and because, unlike many PIs, J.J. encourages that, our successful collaboration have pioneered a new era of genomics in Drosophila, wherein mutation discovery is facilitated by comparison between near-complete genome assemblies.

When I am not probing into the Drosophila genomes, I hike or cook. I am also part of an Indian NGO named Pratyush (meaning dawn), which is actively trying to improve the lives of economially under-privileged children and women.
